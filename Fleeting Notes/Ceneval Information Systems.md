- A system is a set of components that interact between themselves to achieve a common objective
- An open system includes legislative system, respiratory system and inventory system
- the characteristic of systems to receive input and produce an output is known as **environment interaction**
- The **transaction processing systems** substitute manual procedures for computer based ones. They are well structured routine procedures, including registry management applications.
- **Administrative information systems** are in charge of dealing with support in the situation of well structured decisions
-**Decision taking systems** are systems that help directives take non structured or semi-structured decisions

- **detailed analysis** is the phase of the life cycle where processes of the business are studied to answer questions as: What is being made?, How frequently?, Is there a problem?
- The **design** phase of the life cycle is where control and backup procedure are established
- The **Code (Construction)** phase is where programs are designed, coded, and syntax errors are eliminated
- The **Test** phase of the life cycle is where the system is verified with case samples and real data before handing the system to real users
- The **Maintenance** phase is the part of the life cycle where most of the total time of system development is spent
- Reducing the number of branches/stores could centralize the decision taking process
- A company that wants to decentralize their operations require intranet and client/server networks distributed across personal and server computers
- Operations is one of the 3 great functions(system development, operations, technical systems) and it is in charge of data intake/logging
-  Procedures is where documentation of a system for its maintenance is taken
-  A well design system can still fail
