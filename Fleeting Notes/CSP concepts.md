- a set of variables V{} with domains D not empty of possible values
- C{} set of restrictions where are involves a set of variables
- the goal: to find an asignation of values for all the variables (complete) and they satisfy the set of restrictions (consistent)
- Some CSPs also require a solution that maximize and objective function(optimization problem)

#### types of environments
- discrete and finite domains
- discrete and infinite domains
- continuos domains

#### types o f restrictions
- by arity: unitarias, binarias, n-arias
- absolute constraints: where we can not violate this constraints
- preference constraints: whre the solution is prefered

### TYPES of problems
- computer visioin
- job scheduling
- circuit (chip) design
- product design
- sites configuration

### EXAMPLES
#### map coloring
- Variables: regions={R1,R2,R3}
