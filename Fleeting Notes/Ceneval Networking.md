- the main function of the MAC sub-layer is to regulate access to the medium
- switches use the **origin MAC address** to "self learn" the distribution of connected nodes
- when a connection allows for double way simultaneous data transfer it is called **Full-duplex**   
- the 2 principal advantages fiber optics have over traditional wire are: immunity to electromagnetic noise and transfer speeds
- 10BaseT Ethernet networks have a **star** based topology
- WAN > MAN > LAN > PAN
- the principal function of a modem is to **change digital signals to analogue and vice versa**
- the function of multiplexers used in networks is that several communications share a single high speed channel
- **twisted pair cable** is the most susceptible to electromagnetic interference
- Manchester codification dosen't generate direct current (DC) and there is no danger of desynchronization with a large chain of 1s or 0s
- TCP is responsible for process to process communication
- IP is responsible to machine to machine communication
- DUAL, EIGRP, EGP, IGRP, RIP and RIPv2 protocols uses **distance vector routing**, Hop count
- NLSP,OSPF and IS-IS protocols use **link-state routing**
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and ASBR uses **vector path** algorithm
- distance vector only receives information from neighbor routers
- **split horizon** helps in the prevention of loops
- A host machine can be identified by a IP address, while a program can be identified by a port number
- Switches and Routers are used in WAN's but Hubs are not
- firewall block packages based on ports and IP's
- TELNET protocols helps connect a virtual terminal on a remote machine
- fiber optic is more secure for network communication than coaxial, wireless and twisted pair cable
- Huffman code has variable longitude
- network layer on OSI layer is in charge of choosing the trajectory to reach the host destination
- Transport layer is in charge of handling segments and locating ports
- when 2 computers are on different sub-networks their logical directions (origin and destination) cant change
- Quadrature amplitude modulation **(QAM)** is a combination of Amplitude Shift Keying **(ASK)** and Phase Shift Keying **(PSK)**
- Bandwidth = max Hz - min Hz
- amplitude = watts * dB
- AM stations use FDM (Frequency-Division Multiplexing) multiplexers
- Hamming is used to identify and correct an error in a single receptor
- a frame is 1,518 bytes long
- hubs, cables, connectors and repeaters work on layer 1 of the OSI model 
- bridges and switches works on layer 2 of the OSI model
- router works on level 3
- a VLAN can be generated from a switch
- IP Types (sub-mask)
	-  A: 1-126 (255.0.0.0)
	-   B:128-191 (255.255.0.0)
	-    C:192-223 (255.255.255.0)
- DNS gives a IP from a logical name
